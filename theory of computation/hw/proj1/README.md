* Expriment 1

  run `expriment1.py`

* Expriment 2

  note: the file reading code uses a relative path, please note python runing path.

   `re.i` and `lang.i` are the regular expression pattern file and the test sentence. The re pattern can only process connection, union, star, plus and parenthesis.

  If you want to draw a diagram, you need to install the `graphviz` package and uncommented related code. But if your operation system is Windows, you might meet installation and environment variable problem, so I suggest if you want to see the image, you would better run it on  Linix or Mac OS. 

* Report

  The expriment report is the file `project1 report.md`. 
  
  If you do not have a markdown editer,cannot understan the markdown source code, or cannot see the images or formula, I suggest you download and install `Typora` to read it.
